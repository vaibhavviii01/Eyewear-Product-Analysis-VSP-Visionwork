# Eyewear-Product-Analysis-VSP-Visionwork

This project focuses on optimizing the product assortment strategy for VSP Visionworks, a leading eye care service provider in the U.S. By analyzing historical sales data and frame attributes, the project aims to identify key factors influencing eyewear purchases and develop strategies to improve inventory management, sales, and customer satisfaction.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clustering techniques, and predictive modeling, we identified customer preferences, product demand, and pricing strategies. The goal was to optimize inventory by determining the most popular frame styles, materials, and sizes, while also predicting future sales for the VSP+ Safinia series.

ðŸ“Œ Project Insights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Cleaned and transformed the data to handle missing values, zero values, and outliers.
Analyzed customer demographics and purchasing behavior across various attributes such as style, color, material, and brand.
Customer Segmentation (Clustering):

Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchasing patterns and geographic regions.
Identified distinct consumer segments with varying preferences for frame styles, colors, and materials, leading to targeted recommendations for inventory management.
Sales Prediction (Random Forest Regression):

Built a predictive model to forecast sales for different frame configurations.
Identified the most significant features influencing sales, such as style, frame shape, and material.
Pricing Strategy:

Developed a pricing model to estimate the optimal price range for top-selling products, considering factors such as brand prestige, frame material, and style popularity.

ðŸ“Œ Key Findings:

The most popular frame styles are Modified Rectangle and Rectangle, with Acetate being the preferred material.
Key customer segments include fashion-forward urban females and mothers with children, each with distinct product preferences.
The optimal product configurations for maximum sales involve a mix of designer styles with variations in color and material.
The recommended price range for popular frames spans from $100 to $260, ensuring a variety of SKUs that cater to both budget-conscious and premium customers.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations:

Implement tailored inventory strategies based on customer segment preferences.
Introduce augmented reality (AR) glasses try-on features to enhance the customer shopping experience.
Focus on broad product representation while maintaining a balance between high-demand and niche products for different customer groups.
